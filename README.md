## Installation
Simply download the compiled source from the [releases](https://github.com/pelpadesa/LinkTracker/releases) page, extract it into an empty directory, then run `LinkTracker.exe`

## Compiling the Source
You can compile LinkTracker's source using Visual Studio, although you'll need to manually create an empty `links.csv` in the executable's directory for it to work.
